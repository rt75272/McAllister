## 🎯 How the Progressive System Works

### Difficulty Levels
1. **Easy**: Numbers 5-10, operations with 1-5
2. **Medium**: Numbers 1-100, operations with 1-50  
3. **Hard**: Numbers 1-1000, operations with 1-500

### Progression Requirements
- **Easy → Medium**: Answer 4 consecutive questions correctly
- **Medium → Hard**: Answer 7 consecutive questions correctly
- **Victory**: Answer 5 hard questions correctly

### Operations Supported
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (−)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷) - with results rounded to 2 decimal places

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd math_practice
   ```

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv mcallister
   source mcallister/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   # OR
   mcallister\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash

## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing Difficulty Settings

In `app.py`, you can modify these variables:

```python
easy_num = 4      # Questions needed to advance from easy to medium
medium_num = 7    # Questions needed to advance from medium to hard  
hard_num = 5      # Questions needed for victory in hard mode
num_rounded = 2   # Decimal places for division results
```

### Session Management

The application uses Flask sessions to track:
- Current difficulty level
- Correct answer streaks per difficulty
- Hard mode victories
- Performance records
